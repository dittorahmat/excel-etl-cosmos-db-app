# CSV Delimiter Detection Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of automatic CSV delimiter detection for the Excel ETL Cosmos DB application. The feature allows the system to automatically detect and handle both comma-separated and semicolon-separated CSV files without requiring different file extensions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Delimiter Detection Utility
- **File**: `server/src/utils/csv-delimiter-detector.ts`
- **Function**: `detectCsvDelimiter(filePath: string)`
- **Logic**: 
  - Reads the first few lines of a CSV file
  - Counts occurrences of potential delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab) outside of quoted fields
  - Selects the delimiter with the most consistent count across lines
  - Handles edge cases like quoted fields containing delimiters

### 2. Modified File Parser Service
- **File**: `server/src/services/file-parser/file-parser.service.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for the new delimiter detection utility
  - Modified `parseCsv` method to accept an optional delimiter parameter
  - Updated `parseFile` method to detect delimiter for CSV files before parsing
  - Configured `csv-parser` library to use the detected delimiter

### 3. Updated Test Files
- **File**: `test/test/services/ingestion/ingestion.service.test.ts`
- **Changes**: Updated test expectations to account for the new immediate delimiter detection behavior

- **File**: `test/test/utils/csv-delimiter-detector.test.ts`
- **Changes**: Created comprehensive tests for the delimiter detection functionality

## Technical Details

### Delimiter Detection Algorithm
1. Read the first 5 lines of the file
2. For each line, count occurrences of each potential delimiter (`,`, `;`, `\t`) outside of quoted fields
3. Calculate consistency scores for each delimiter based on how uniform the counts are across lines
4. Select the delimiter with the highest consistency score, or in case of a tie, the one with more total occurrences

### Quoted Field Handling
The delimiter detection properly handles quoted fields by:
- Recognizing both single and double quotes
- Ignoring delimiters that appear within quoted fields
- Handling escaped quotes (doubled quotes) correctly

### Backward Compatibility
- Excel files (.xlsx, .xls, .xlsm) continue to be processed as before
- Comma-separated CSV files continue to work as before
- New support for semicolon-separated CSV files
- No changes to the public API

## Testing
- Created unit tests for delimiter detection with various CSV formats
- Updated existing tests to reflect new behavior
- Verified functionality with both comma and semicolon-separated files
- Tested edge cases including quoted fields and mixed content

## Usage
The system now automatically detects the delimiter used in CSV files. No changes are required to client code - the ingestion service will automatically handle both comma-separated and semicolon-separated CSV files correctly.
