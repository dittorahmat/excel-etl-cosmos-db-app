## Date: Mon Aug 25 2025

## Updates Performed

1. Ran `npm update` on root package:
   - Added 3 packages
   - Removed 6 packages
   - Changed 18 packages
   - Fixed some vulnerabilities

2. Ran `npm update` on server package:
   - Updated dependencies to latest patch/minor versions

3. Ran `npm audit fix` on both root and server packages:
   - Addressed vulnerabilities that could be fixed without breaking changes
   - Some vulnerabilities remain that require major version updates

4. Updated package.json files to reflect current dependency versions:
   - Updated root package.json with current dependency versions
   - Updated server package.json with current dependency versions
   - Ran `npm install` to ensure package-lock.json consistency

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

1. **esbuild** - Moderate severity vulnerability
   - Fixed by updating vite to version 6.3.5 (breaking change)
   - Run `npm audit fix --force` to apply this update

2. **xlsx** - High severity vulnerability
   - Prototype Pollution and ReDoS vulnerabilities
   - No fix available in current version
   - Consider replacing with alternative library or accepting risk

## Recommendations

1. For the esbuild vulnerability, you can run:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix --force
   ```
   This will update vite to version 6.3.5, which is a breaking change and requires testing.

2. For the xlsx vulnerability, consider:
   - Monitoring for security updates
   - Evaluating alternative libraries for Excel processing
   - Implementing additional input validation as a mitigation

3. Review the DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md for major version updates that should be planned.
