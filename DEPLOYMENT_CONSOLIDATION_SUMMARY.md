# Deployment Documentation Consolidation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to consolidate the deployment documentation.

## Files Removed

1. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Older, less detailed deployment guide
   - A backup was created at `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md.backup`

## Files Kept

1. `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATED.md` - Updated, comprehensive EasyPanel deployment guide
2. `build-for-easypanel.sh` - Build script for EasyPanel deployment
3. `start-for-easypanel.sh` - Start script for EasyPanel deployment
4. `nixpacks.toml` - Nixpacks configuration for EasyPanel deployment
5. `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for container deployment
6. `staticwebapp.config.json` - Azure Static Web Apps configuration
7. `staticwebapp.mock.config.json` - Mock configuration for local development

## Files Added

1. `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Consolidated deployment guide that references all deployment options and files

## Files Updated

1. `README.md` - Updated the Deployment section to reference the new consolidated guide

## Reasoning

The `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATED.md` file was kept as the primary deployment guide because it:
- Is the most up-to-date guide
- Contains specific fixes for common deployment issues
- Provides detailed instructions for EasyPanel deployment
- Includes troubleshooting tips

The other files were kept because they provide necessary configuration and scripts for different deployment scenarios.

The `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` was removed because it was largely superseded by the more detailed and updated `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATED.md`, with some overlapping content.
