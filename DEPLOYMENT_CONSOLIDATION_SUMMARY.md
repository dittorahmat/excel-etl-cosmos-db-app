# Deployment Documentation Consolidation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to consolidate the deployment documentation.

## Files Removed

1. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Older, less detailed deployment guide
   - A backup was created at `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md.backup`
2. `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATED.md` - Previous EasyPanel deployment guide (replaced by consolidated guide)
   - A backup was created at `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATED.md.backup`
3. `EASYPANEL_ALTERNATIVE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Alternative EasyPanel deployment guide (consolidated into main guide)
   - A backup was created at `EASYPANEL_ALTERNATIVE_DEPLOYMENT.md.backup`

## Files Kept

1. `build-for-easypanel.sh` - Build script for EasyPanel deployment
2. `start-for-easypanel.sh` - Start script for EasyPanel deployment
3. `nixpacks.toml` - Nixpacks configuration for EasyPanel deployment (updated with better error checking)
4. `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for container deployment
5. `staticwebapp.config.json` - Azure Static Web Apps configuration
6. `staticwebapp.mock.config.json` - Mock configuration for local development

## Files Added

1. `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Consolidated deployment guide that references all deployment options and files
2. `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive, consolidated EasyPanel deployment guide

## Files Updated

1. `README.md` - Updated the Deployment section to reference the new consolidated guide

## Reasoning

The `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` file was created as a consolidated guide because it:
- Combines both the Nixpacks-based deployment approach and the alternative method using EasyPanel's built-in package installation features
- Provides a comprehensive, single-source guide for EasyPanel deployment
- Eliminates redundancy between separate documents
- Makes it easier for users to find the deployment method that works for their environment

The other files were kept because they provide necessary configuration and scripts for different deployment scenarios.

The `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` was removed because it was largely superseded by the more detailed and updated guides, with some overlapping content.
