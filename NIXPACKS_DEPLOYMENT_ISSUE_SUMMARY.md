# Nixpacks Deployment Issue Summary

## Current Status

We've identified and attempted to fix several issues with the Nixpacks deployment process:

1. **Package Name Issue**: Fixed by using `nodejs-18_x` instead of `nodejs_18` and removing the separate `npm` package specification.

2. **File Path Issue**: Identified that the `deploy_output` directory was not being tracked by Git due to `.gitignore` rules, which was causing files to be missing from the build context.

3. **Nixpacks Default Behavior**: Nixpacks automatically tries to run `npm install` when it detects a `package.json` file, but it wasn't finding the file where it expected it to be.

## Root Cause

The main issue appears to be that Nixpacks is not correctly copying files to the expected location in the Docker container. The error consistently shows:

```
npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/package.json'
```

This suggests that either:
1. The files are not being copied to the Docker container at all, or
2. They're being copied to a different location than where Nixpacks expects them to be.

## Recommended Solution

Based on our analysis, we recommend using the **Alternative Deployment Method** described in `EASYPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` which:

1. Uses EasyPanel's built-in package installation features to install Node.js
2. Uses our custom build and start scripts (`build-for-easypanel.sh` and `start-for-easypanel.sh`)
3. Gives us more control over the build process and file paths

This approach bypasses the Nixpacks file copying behavior entirely and should be more reliable.

## If You Want to Continue Troubleshooting Nixpacks

If you want to continue trying to get the Nixpacks-based deployment working, here are some things to try:

1. **Check Git Tracking**: Ensure all necessary files are being tracked by Git and are not excluded by `.gitignore`.

2. **Simplify nixpacks.toml**: Try a minimal configuration that only specifies the Node.js version and start command.

3. **Debug File Paths**: Add more debugging output to the Nixpacks configuration to see exactly what files are being copied to the Docker container.

4. **Check Nixpacks Documentation**: Look for specific configuration options that control file copying behavior.

However, given the time invested and the persistent issues, we recommend using the alternative deployment method which we know works.
