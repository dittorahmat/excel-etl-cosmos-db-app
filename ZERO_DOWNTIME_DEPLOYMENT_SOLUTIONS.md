# Zero-Downtime Deployment Solutions

This document explains the deployment approaches available for the Excel to Cosmos DB Dashboard application.

## Issues with Original Zero-Downtime Script

The original `zero-downtime-deploy.sh` script had several issues:

1. It used `docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans` which stops existing containers before starting new ones, causing downtime
2. It didn't implement any true zero-downtime deployment pattern
3. It lacked proper health checks and rollback mechanisms
4. It didn't handle deployment failures gracefully

## Current Deployment Solution

### Improved Zero-Downtime Deployment (`improved-zero-downtime-deploy.sh`)

This is the currently recommended approach that improves upon the original by:

- Updating services one by one to minimize downtime
- Including proper health checks before proceeding
- Implementing error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Using `--no-deps` flag to update individual services without affecting others

## Usage

### Improved Zero-Downtime Deployment
```bash
./improved-zero-downtime-deploy.sh
```

## How It Works

1. Builds new Docker images
2. Updates the `excel-to-cosmos` service first, waiting for it to be healthy
3. Updates the `nginx` service
4. Performs cleanup of unused resources

## Benefits

- **Zero Downtime**: The application remains available during deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed deployments are automatically rolled back
- **Health Checks**: Verifies service health before completing deployment
- **Resource Cleanup**: Unused containers and images are automatically cleaned up

## Note

Previously, alternative deployment approaches such as Blue-Green deployment were considered but have been removed as they require more complex infrastructure than currently available. The improved zero-downtime deployment approach is the most suitable for the current setup.
