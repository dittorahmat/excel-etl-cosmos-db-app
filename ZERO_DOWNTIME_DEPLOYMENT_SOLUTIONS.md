# Zero-Downtime Deployment Solutions

This document explains the different deployment approaches available for the Excel to Cosmos DB Dashboard application.

## Issues with Original Zero-Downtime Script

The original `zero-downtime-deploy.sh` script had several issues:

1. It used `docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans` which stops existing containers before starting new ones, causing downtime
2. It didn't implement any true zero-downtime deployment pattern
3. It lacked proper health checks and rollback mechanisms
4. It didn't handle deployment failures gracefully

## New Deployment Solutions

### 1. Improved Zero-Downtime Deployment (`improved-zero-downtime-deploy.sh`)

This script improves upon the original by:

- Updating services one by one to minimize downtime
- Including proper health checks before proceeding
- Implementing error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Using `--no-deps` flag to update individual services without affecting others

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment (`blue-green-deploy.sh`)

This script implements a true blue-green deployment pattern:

- Maintains two separate environments (blue and green)
- Deploys new versions to the inactive environment
- Performs health checks on the new environment before switching traffic
- Switches traffic by updating a configuration file
- Gracefully shuts down the old environment after successful deployment

## Usage

### Improved Zero-Downtime Deployment
```bash
./improved-zero-downtime-deploy.sh
```

### Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
./blue-green-deploy.sh
```

## How They Work

### Improved Zero-Downtime Deployment
1. Builds new Docker images
2. Updates the `excel-to-cosmos` service first, waiting for it to be healthy
3. Updates the `nginx` service
4. Performs cleanup of unused resources

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. Determines which environment is currently live
2. Deploys the new version to the inactive environment
3. Performs comprehensive health checks
4. Switches traffic by updating a configuration file
5. Shuts down the old environment

## Benefits

- **Zero Downtime**: Both approaches ensure the application remains available during deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed deployments are automatically rolled back
- **Health Checks**: Both approaches verify service health before completing deployment
- **Resource Cleanup**: Unused containers and images are automatically cleaned up
