# CI/CD GitHub Actions Workflow Plan

## Notes
- Project uses monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend (see multiple package.json files).
- CI/CD requirements: lint and test on PR, deploy frontend/backend on merge to main, monitor deployment with Azure Monitor.
- Use context7 mcp for documentation, Typescript for scripts when possible.
- Do not edit .env directly; update .env.example with variable descriptions.
- .env.example is now fully updated and in sync with .env, with clear documentation and placeholders.
- Service principal creation for CI/CD is currently blocked by insufficient Azure permissions; must resolve before workflow validation.
- Exploring use of existing Azure AD application credentials (VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID, VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID, etc.) for CI/CD authentication as an alternative to service principal with Contributor role.
- If admin permissions remain blocked, consider using Azure publish profile for deployment authentication as a fallback (does not require admin role assignment).
- **Preferred approach:** Use Azure publish profile for deployment authentication to minimize admin intervention. Document this as the default workflow for CI/CD deployments.
- Frontend (Azure Static Web Apps) workflow reviewed and confirmed ready for automated CI/CD deployment.
- Production Azure AD redirect URI must be set to the deployed Static Web App URL and registered in Azure AD app registration for correct authentication flow.
- Currently proceeding with backend CI/CD deployment testing before frontend validation.
- CI/CD workflow failed at linting step due to missing typescript-eslint dependency; must update workflow or dependencies to resolve.
- CI/CD workflow and build/lint issues will be resolved locally before triggering further GitHub Actions runs.
- Encountered ESLint config error: "require is not defined in ES module scope" due to package.json specifying "type": "module" and ESLint config using require syntax. Must use ES module syntax (import/export) or rename config to .cjs for CommonJS.
- Attempted both CommonJS and ES module syntaxes in eslint.config.js; must ensure config matches Node module type expectations.
- Local ESLint run fails with: "Cannot find package 'typescript-eslint' imported from eslint.config.js" even though package is present in devDependencies and installed. Indicates possible ESM/CommonJS or node_modules resolution issue. Need to debug local ESLint config and package resolution before proceeding.
- Created separate ESLint config files: `.eslintrc.cjs` for frontend, `server/.eslintrc.cjs` for backend/server, both using CommonJS for compatibility with ESLint and Node module resolution.
- Updated lint script in package.json to explicitly use new config files and extensions.
- Encountered ESLint CLI error: "Invalid option '--ext' - perhaps you meant '-c'? You're using eslint.config.js, some command line flags are no longer available." Need to update lint script to be compatible with new ESLint flat config (no --ext flag, use glob patterns or config).
- Updated lint script for ESLint flat config compatibility, but error persists: "Cannot find package 'typescript-eslint' imported from eslint.config.js". Indicates unresolved ESM/flat config/module resolution issue. Further debugging required.
- Performed full clean and reinstall of node_modules and package-lock.json to rule out dependency corruption; TypeScript ESLint packages confirmed present, but error persists. Further root cause analysis needed.
- Discovered multiple ESLint config files (eslint.config.js in root and node_modules). Next step: simplify config by removing or renaming conflicting files and ensure only one config is used for linting.
- Removed root eslint.config.js file to prevent config conflict; lint script now explicitly uses .eslintrc.cjs configs for frontend and backend. Next: validate linting works locally and config/module conflict is resolved.
- Linting now fails with: "ESLint couldn't determine the plugin \"@typescript-eslint\" uniquely" due to multiple installations (root and server/node_modules). Next: deduplicate plugin installation (use only root or only server) and ensure consistent ESLint resolution across monorepo.
- Root cause confirmed: duplicate installation of @typescript-eslint plugin in both root and server. Next: remove @typescript-eslint from server/package.json and server/node_modules, ensure only root has the plugin, and update all ESLint configs to resolve from root. Then revalidate linting locally and in CI/CD.
- Duplicate @typescript-eslint dependencies removed from server/package.json. Next: delete server/node_modules, reinstall root dependencies, and validate linting works from root only.
- Updated both root and server ESLint configs to reference the correct (monorepo root) path to tsconfig.server.json. Next: re-run linting and confirm parserOptions.project errors are resolved for all relevant files.
- Both root and server ESLint configs now reference the correct monorepo root tsconfig.server.json. Next: re-run linting and confirm parserOptions.project errors are resolved for all backend files.
- Linting configuration is now correct and parserOptions.project errors are resolved; local build attempted and TypeScript build errors surfaced in backend test files (type incompatibilities, missing/incorrect imports, module resolution, and interface mismatches). Next: triage and fix these build errors to enable successful backend build and CI/CD pipeline progression.
- Backend TypeScript config (tsconfig.server.json) and build script now updated to exclude test files from build output. Next: re-attempt backend build and verify if build errors are resolved.
- Backend build was re-attempted; TypeScript errors remain in backend source files (type incompatibilities, missing/incorrect imports, module resolution, and interface mismatches). Next: triage and fix these errors in backend source files for a successful build.
- Added missing `authenticateToken` middleware export to backend source to resolve TypeScript build error related to missing export in middleware/auth.ts. Continue addressing remaining build errors in backend source files.
- Attempted to locate `AzureBlobStorage` class for fixing missing `deleteFile` method, but class/file was not found in the codebase. Further investigation or user clarification needed to proceed with backend build error resolution.
- Confirmed `AzureBlobStorage` is defined as a TypeScript interface in the Azure config file, but there is no implementation or method for `deleteFile`. Next: implement or stub the missing `deleteFile` method, or clarify its intended behavior and location.
- Added `deleteFile` method to `AzureBlobStorage` interface; next: implement/stub in mock and real implementations.
- Added and implemented/stubbed `deleteFile` method in both mock and real `AzureBlobStorage` implementations. Proceed to backend build error triage.
- All mock and real AzureBlobStorage implementations now include the required `deleteFile` method, including in initializeAzureServices. No further missing method errors remain for this interface.
- Vitest upgraded to ^3.0.0 and vitest-mock-extended to ^3.1.0; dependencies now install successfully. Backend build/test is unblocked. Continue TypeScript error resolution in backend source files.
- Test setup updated to handle Node.js and browser environments; window/global mocking error resolved. Backend tests now run, proceed to address any remaining TypeScript or functional errors in backend tests.
- Backend tests now run, but several fail due to missing modules, incorrect mocks, assertion errors, and mixing Jest/Vitest APIs. Next: triage and fix these backend test failures.
- Confirmed that `apiKeyRepository.ts` exists and is implemented. The missing module error is likely due to an import path, file extension, or mock configuration issue rather than an absent file. Next: review import statements and Vitest mock setup for correct resolution.
- `tsconfig.json` includes `"types": ["node", "jest"]`, which may cause issues with test typings and mocks; should use Vitest types instead of Jest for consistency.
- `tsconfig.json` updated to use Vitest types (`"vitest/globals"`), include test files in `include`, and add module path aliases for better resolution. Test file imports and mocks are being updated to use `.js` extensions and Vitest conventions for ESM compatibility.
- Test utilities (`test-utils.ts`) have been moved to `src/test-utils/index.ts` for ESM compatibility and type safety. Test files are being updated to import from the new path.
- Type issues in backend test utilities and test file have been addressed; test files now use new test-utils path and improved type safety.
- `apiKeyRepository` import and mocking in test file updated to use dynamic `import()` and `vi.mocked` for ESM compatibility; this is a step toward resolving module resolution errors in backend tests.
- `apiKeyRevocation.test.ts` updated to use Vitest syntax and logger mocks; beforeEach is now async for future async setup. Continue updating/fixing other backend test files for Vitest/ESM compatibility and assertion correctness.
- Backend tests now run successfully after fixing Vitest/ESM compatibility and assertion issues. Next: verify backend build success and proceed to frontend workflow/integration testing.
- Backend build is now successfully verified after tsconfig/test config fixes. Next: proceed to frontend workflow/integration testing.
- Backend build was successfully verified; TypeScript build errors were found due to test files being included in the build. Updated tsconfig to exclude test files from build and added/updated tsconfig.test.json for test compilation. Next: proceed to frontend workflow/integration testing.
- Frontend build and tests are now verified as successful. Next: validate GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for both backend and frontend, including deployment and integration.
- CI/CD workflow file updated to handle both frontend and backend deployments (separate jobs for lint/test, frontend deploy, backend deploy; Azure Static Web Apps and Azure App Service both configured). Next: trigger and validate the workflow on GitHub.
- Required GitHub Actions secrets are set up in repository; workflow runs are being validated via GitHub CLI and API.
- The most recent CI/CD workflow run (main branch, push event) completed with a failure. Next: investigate workflow logs and address the root cause before proceeding.
- The failed "Lint and Test" job in the last workflow run did not provide any error logs (log output was empty or unavailable). Next: re-run the workflow to capture error output or investigate log retrieval issues.
