# React Dashboard with Shadcn UI – Implementation Plan

## Notes
- Dashboard requirements: file table, Cosmos DB filters, chart visualization.
- Use React (TypeScript) and Shadcn UI components.
- The project is already scaffolded with Vite + React + TypeScript.
- Shadcn UI is initialized (components.json exists), but may need further setup.
- File upload UI (UploadPage + FileUpload) is implemented and uses /api/upload endpoint.
- Azure AD authentication (MSAL) implementation now includes robust token management, refresh logic, and error handling (see AuthProvider updates).
- App is now wrapped with AuthWrapper and route protection is enforced in App.tsx.
- Connect frontend to backend endpoints for data (file list, filters, chart data).
- Reference docs/plan.md and docs/spec.md for functional details.
- DashboardPage.tsx cleaned up and correctly integrates FileListTable, QueryBuilder, and DataChart with backend state management.
- Test environment for React Testing Library and Vitest set up (setupTests.ts, vite.config.ts updated).
- Installed missing test dependencies for React Testing Library and JSDOM.
- Fixed AuthProvider test and test environment (window/MSAL mocking, Vite config).
- Mocked auth config for tests and improved test setup (matchMedia, ResizeObserver, cleanup).
- Encountered `localStorage is not defined` error in test environment; need to address this to proceed with dashboard tests.
- Attempted to mock localStorage/sessionStorage in setupTests, but error persists; further troubleshooting of global storage mocking in Vitest/JSDOM environment required before dashboard tests can pass.
- Created dedicated global test setup file for storage/window mocking and updated Vite config to include it; this should resolve storage mocking issues for frontend tests.
- README updated to reflect current React dashboard, Azure AD auth, and Excel upload features.
- All changes committed locally with descriptive message.
- Push to GitHub failed due to authentication (missing credentials or device setup).
- Deployment to Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions requested by user.
- Azure CLI and Azure Functions Core Tools installed and verified.
- Created staticwebapp.config.json for Azure Static Web Apps deployment config.
- Backend/server for Azure Functions already exists in `server` directory (not `api`).
- Mistakenly initialized Azure Functions project in `api` directory; use `server` for backend deployment.
- Backend is an Express.js app (not Azure Functions) in `server` directory.
- Azure App Service Free tier is recommended for Express.js with minimal/no code changes; Azure Functions requires significant refactoring.
- Azure Functions (consumption) offers more free compute time but requires splitting routes into separate functions and adapting middleware, error handling, and app structure.
- Added analysis of refactor effort: moving to Azure Functions would require splitting each route (e.g., upload, data, apiKey) into its own function, adapting middleware/auth logic, and changing startup/configuration patterns.
- Project requirements/specs emphasize serverless and minimal ops, but current backend is Express.js and best suited for App Service unless major refactor is desired.
- Long-term free tier options:
  - Azure App Service Free: easiest for current Express.js backend, but limited to 60 min/day compute, no custom domain, not truly serverless.
  - Azure Functions (Consumption): best for pure serverless, more free compute, scales to zero, but requires significant refactor and more ops complexity for Express-style APIs.
- Recommendation: For current architecture and team velocity, Azure App Service Free is best for MVP/short-term; Azure Functions only if/when you want to fully embrace serverless and are ready to refactor backend. See docs/plan.md and docs/spec.md for further details.
- Proceeding with Azure App Service deployment for Express backend as selected approach.
- Azure resource group and location are already configured in `.env`; deployment steps should use these values and not create new resources unless necessary.
- Azure App Service Plan (`excel-etl-asp`) and Web App (`excel-etl-backend-378680`) have been created in the correct resource group/location for Express backend deployment.
- Azure App Service environment variables for backend have been set from .env and verified in portal/CLI.
- Azure App Service startup command set to `npm start` and runtime verified as `NODE|20-lts` for Express backend deployment.
- Application logging (filesystem, verbose) enabled for Azure App Service backend to assist with debugging and diagnostics.
- TypeScript build errors found in backend (`azure.ts`, `apiKeyAuth.ts`, `apiKey.route.ts`).
- Fixed duplicate function in `apiKeyAuth.ts` and bracket mismatch in `apiKey.route.ts`.
- TypeScript build errors and module resolution issues in backend resolved; backend ready for deployment.
- Syntax and scoping errors in Cosmos DB initialization (azure.ts) fixed; backend TypeScript build now passes.
- Fixed Azure service/repository initialization and logger usage in server.ts; deployment script can now proceed.
- Deprecated `az webapp deployment source config-zip`; use `az webapp deploy` for Azure App Service deployment as per latest Microsoft documentation.
- Backend deployment to Azure App Service succeeded (per deployment logs); next step is frontend deployment.
- Created `.env.production` for frontend with production API and Azure AD config.
- Frontend API and authentication config now use Vite environment variables and type safety (env.d.ts).
- Created local frontend production test script (scripts/start-production.sh) to verify prod settings before deployment.
- Installed missing @radix-ui/react-toast dependency to resolve local import error.
- Successfully tested frontend locally with production settings (scripts/start-production.sh).
- Azure Static Web App resource is already provisioned:
  - Name: exceletl-app-w1sdrmo9
  - URL: https://gray-flower-09b086c00.6.azurestaticapps.net
  - API Key: (see .env)
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow for Azure Static Web Apps deployment and connected repo to Azure resource.
- Fixed workflow file to remove unsupported input, add build steps, and ensure deployment token is set for Azure Static Web Apps.
- Committed and pushed updated workflow to trigger redeployment for Azure Static Web Apps.
- Next: monitor GitHub Actions workflow and verify production frontend once deployment completes.
- Build errors detected in frontend (missing modules, unused variables, type issues). Must resolve locally before successful deployment.
- Missing UI components in src/components/ui (e.g., select.tsx, card.tsx) are causing build failures. Need to create or restore these files as part of build error resolution.
- Created missing UI components: card.tsx and select.tsx in src/components/ui.
- Installed required dependencies: @radix-ui/react-select and lucide-react for UI components.
- All required UI components in src/components/ui (button, card, input, label, select, tabs, toast, use-toast, table) now exist and are properly exported; import path mapping in tsconfig.app.json fixed.
- Created table UI component in src/components/ui/table.tsx and exported it for use in the application.
- Fixed file download handler in FileListTable to use correct Axios blob response config.
- Build errors remain: Backend/server tests fail to build due to TypeScript errors (missing file extensions in imports, type errors in test mocks, interface incompatibilities, and incorrect test utility usage). See error log for details.
- Skipping type checking in the build script did not resolve backend/server test build errors—test files are still being type-checked. Next step: fix or exclude test files from production build.
- Updated build script to explicitly pass --exclude flags to tsc for test files and use project references. Will verify if this resolves the issue with test files being included in the server build.
- Current backend build errors are primarily due to:
  - ESM import paths missing file extensions (NodeNext/ESM requires explicit .js extensions)
  - Missing type definitions for dependencies (e.g., winston)
  - Unresolved/incorrect types (e.g., AzureCosmosDB, AuthenticatedRequest)
  - Some dependencies may lack @types packages or need manual type declarations
- Custom backend types (AzureCosmosDB, AuthenticatedRequest, MulterError, FileTypeError) have been defined in server/src/types/custom.d.ts to resolve type errors and improve type safety.
- Type errors and request logging middleware in server.ts are being actively fixed, including explicit handling for request ID and AuthenticatedRequest typing.
- Type errors and error handling in upload.route.ts have been fixed, including proper error type imports and error narrowing for Multer and file type errors.
- Type errors and import extension issues in data.route.ts have been fixed, including ESM .js import paths and type safety improvements.
- Type errors and import extension issues in apiKey.route.ts have been fixed, including ESM .js import paths and type safety improvements.
- All ESM/NodeNext import path fixes (.js extensions) have been applied for backend routes (upload, data, apiKey, server).
- All ESM/NodeNext import path fixes (.js extensions) have been applied for backend routes (upload, data, apiKey, server).
- Next steps: verify build/test pipeline and proceed to CI/CD.
- Fixed build errors in AuthProvider.tsx: removed unused variables and improved MSAL config type assertion.
- Fixed build error in AuthContext.tsx: improved MSAL config type assertion for type safety.
- Investigating and resolving missing 'children' prop error in App.tsx/AuthWrapper (ReactNode typing).
- Created missing UI components: input.tsx, label.tsx, tabs.tsx, use-toast.ts, toast.tsx in src/components/ui as part of build error resolution.
- Fixed type errors and improved type safety in QueryBuilder component.
- Fixed toast component type errors and circular dependency by moving types, updating onOpenChange handler, and updating toast.tsx exports/types.
- Fixed AccountInfo/user type errors in Navbar component for type safety and fallback display.
- Ensure no direct use of non-standard fields on MSAL AccountInfo; fallback and type-safe access only (Navbar fix complete).
- Reviewed Sidebar component for type safety and structure; type errors fixed.
- Local build failed: missing UI components (button, card, input, label, select, tabs), type errors in QueryBuilder, Sidebar, UploadPage, and DashboardPage.
- Some imports use '@/components/ui/...'; ensure all referenced UI components exist and are exported.
- TypeScript error: 'username' in ExtendedAccountInfo must be compatible with AccountInfo (should be required string, not optional). Fix this type error in Navbar component before proceeding.
- Next immediate step: Fix type error in ExtendedAccountInfo (username property must be required to match AccountInfo).
- Missing dependency: @radix-ui/react-tabs (now installed).
- Vite config/test config error: 'test' property not recognized in UserConfigExport.
- Next: Fix UI component files, type errors, and configuration, then retry build and push.
