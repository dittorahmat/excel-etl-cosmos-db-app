## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- [x] MFA is enforced at the Azure AD level (no application implementation needed)
- [ ] Document Azure AD MFA requirements for administrators
- [ ] Add user guidance for MFA setup in the application help section

> **Note:** MFA is managed through Azure AD policies. No application code changes are needed as Azure AD handles the MFA challenge before issuing tokens to the application.

### Session Management
- [ ] Set appropriate session timeout periods
- [ ] Implement session fixation protection
- [ ] Add secure token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Implement concurrent session control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Fine-grained permission system
- [ ] Regular access reviews
- [ ] Segregation of duties enforcement

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- [ ] Implement encryption at rest for sensitive data in Cosmos DB
- [ ] Enable Always Encrypted for highly sensitive fields
- [ ] Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Ensure all data in transit uses TLS 1.2+

### Key Management
- [ ] Implement Azure Key Vault for key management
- [ ] Set up automatic key rotation
- [ ] Implement key versioning and rollover

### Data Retention
- [ ] Implement automated data retention policies
- [ ] Secure data deletion procedures
- [ ] Data classification and handling procedures

## API Security

### Security Headers
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Add X-Content-Type-Options and X-Frame-Options headers
- [ ] Implement Referrer-Policy and Feature-Policy headers

### Request/Response Security
- [ ] Add input validation for all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- [ ] Add API versioning with clear deprecation policies
- [ ] Implement request/response signing

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement more granular rate limiting
- [ ] Add rate limiting based on user roles
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts

## Logging & Monitoring

### Security Logging
- [ ] Comprehensive security event logging
- [ ] Log all authentication attempts (success/failure)
- [ ] Record sensitive operations (data access, configuration changes)
- [ ] Ensure logs include relevant context (timestamps, user IDs, IPs)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- [ ] Implement automated anomaly detection
- [ ] Monitor for unusual data access patterns
- [ ] Implement SIEM integration

## Compliance & Documentation

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive security policy documentation
- [ ] Document data flow diagrams
- [ ] Maintain an up-to-date asset inventory
- [ ] Create incident response playbooks

### Audit Trail
- [ ] Implement immutable audit logs
- [ ] Schedule regular security audits
- [ ] Document and enforce data retention policies
- [ ] Implement automated compliance reporting

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- [ ] Implement network segmentation
- [ ] Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and firewalls
- [ ] Enable DDoS protection
- [ ] Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Secrets Management
- [ ] Use Azure Key Vault for all secrets
- [ ] Implement just-in-time access
- [ ] Monitor and alert on secret access
- [ ] Implement secret rotation automation

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Critical Security (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement missing security headers
- [ ] Set up comprehensive security logging
- [ ] Review and update all dependencies
- [ ] Implement basic rate limiting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Protection (1 month)
- [ ] Enable MFA for all user accounts
- [ ] Implement encryption at rest for sensitive data
- [ ] Create initial security documentation
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring and alerts

### Phase 3: Advanced Security (3 months)
- [ ] Implement fine-grained RBAC
- [ ] Set up automated key rotation
- [ ] Implement automated compliance reporting
- [ ] Conduct security awareness training

### Ongoing (Quarterly)
- [ ] Security awareness training
- [ ] Security audits and penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update incident response plans

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Unauthorized data access | High | Medium | Implement MFA, fine-grained access controls |
| Data breaches | High | Low | Enable encryption at rest, implement DLP |
| API abuse | Medium | High | Implement rate limiting, API gateway |
| Insufficient logging | Medium | Medium | Implement comprehensive security logging |
| Compliance violations | High | Medium | Regular audits, automated compliance checks |

## Dependencies
- Azure AD for identity management
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure Monitor for logging and monitoring
- Azure Security Center for threat protection
