# Security Checklist for Azure AD Authentication

This document outlines the security measures implemented and those that need periodic review.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Authentication
- [x] Azure AD integration with OAuth 2.0 and PKCE
- [x] JWT token validation with proper signature verification
- [x] Token expiration handling
- [x] Secure storage of client secrets in environment variables
- [x] CORS configuration to limit allowed origins
- [x] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [x] Secure HTTP headers via Helmet middleware

### 2. Session Management
- [x] Short-lived access tokens (default 1 hour)
- [x] Secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- [x] Token revocation on logout

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Authentication attempt logging
- [x] Error logging with appropriate log levels
- [x] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [x] Monitoring script for authentication metrics

## üîÑ Periodic Review Required

### 1. Azure AD Configuration
- [ ] Review and rotate client secrets every 90 days
- [ ] Audit Azure AD app registrations for unused applications
- [ ] Review and update API permissions (minimum required permissions)
- [ ] Check for suspicious sign-ins in Azure AD logs

### 2. Application Security
- [ ] Review and update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Rotate JWT signing keys (if using custom signing)
- [ ] Review and update CORS configuration
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- [ ] Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor for unusual authentication patterns
- [ ] Review authentication logs weekly
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening Recommendations

### 1. Infrastructure
- [ ] Enable Azure AD Conditional Access policies
- [ ] Implement IP-based restrictions for admin endpoints
- [ ] Set up Azure Security Center for threat detection
- [ ] Enable Azure AD Identity Protection

### 2. Application
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Add suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

## üö® Incident Response

### 1. Suspected Breach
1. Immediately revoke compromised tokens
2. Reset affected user credentials
3. Review audit logs for suspicious activities
4. Rotate all application secrets
5. Notify affected users if necessary

### 2. Security Contact
