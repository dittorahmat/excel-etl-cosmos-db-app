# Security Compliance Overview

## Why This Matters

Keeping our application secure is like protecting a house. We need strong locks (security measures) to keep bad actors out and valuable items (data) safe. This document explains how we protect our application and follow important security rules.

## Key Security Areas

1. **Who Gets In** (Authentication & Access Control)
2. **Protecting Information** (Data Protection)
3. **Safe Communication** (API Security)
4. **Strong Foundations** (Infrastructure Security)
5. **Following the Rules** (Compliance with Standards)

## Introduction

Think of our application like a bank. Just as a bank needs strong security to protect money, we need strong security to protect data. This document explains how we keep our application safe and follow important security rules.

## Who Gets In

### Secure Logins with Microsoft
**The Basics**: We use Microsoft's secure login system to make sure only the right people can access our application.

**Why It's Important**: Just like your house key, we need to make sure only authorized people can get in.

**How We Do It**:
- **One Login for Everything**: Users sign in once to access all their apps (like using one key for your house and car).
- **Extra Security Check**: We require more than just a password (like a text message code) to confirm it's really you.
- **Smart Protection**: The system watches for unusual login attempts (like someone trying to break in) and asks for extra verification.

### Service Access Control
**The Basics**: Special codes (API keys) let different parts of our system talk to each other safely.

**Why It's Important**: These are like special handshakes that only our trusted services know.

**How We Do It**:
- **Secret Codes**: Each service has its own unique code.
- **Regular Changes**: We change these codes regularly, like changing your passwords.
- **Limited Access**: We control exactly what each code can access.

## Protecting Information

### Safe Storage of Secrets
**The Basics**: We keep important information (like passwords) in special, secure places.

**Why It's Important**: Just like you wouldn't leave your house key under the mat, we don't leave sensitive information where others can find it.

**How We Do It**:
- **Separate Storage**: Sensitive information is kept separate from the main code.
- **Different Settings**: We use different settings for testing and real use.
- **No Accidental Sharing**: We make sure secrets don't get accidentally shared in our code.

### Cloud Storage Safety
**The Basics**: We use Microsoft's secure cloud to store all our data safely.

**Why It's Important**: This is like keeping your valuables in a bank vault instead of under your bed.

**How We Do It**:
- **Encrypted Connections**: All data is scrambled when moving between systems.
- **Limited Access**: Only people who need to see the data can access it.
- **Regular Checks**: We regularly check that everything is secure.

## Safe Communication

### Checking What Comes In
**The Basics**: We carefully check all information that comes into our system.

**Why It's Important**: Just like you wouldn't accept a package without checking who it's from, we verify all incoming data.

**How We Do It**:
- **Data Checks**: We make sure all information is in the right format.
- **Size Limits**: We limit how much data can be sent at once to prevent overload.
- **Extra Security**: We double-check that the person sending data is who they say they are.

### Managing Traffic
**The Basics**: We control how many requests our system accepts to keep it running smoothly.

**Why It's Important**: This prevents our system from being overwhelmed, like limiting how many people can enter a store at once.

**How We Do It**:
- **Visitor Limits**: We limit how many requests one computer can make.
- **Fair Usage**: Different types of users have different limits.
- **Clear Messages**: We tell users when they're approaching their limit.

## Strong Foundations

### Network Protection
**The Basics**: We protect the digital "roads" that connect our application to the internet.

**Why It's Important**: Just like roads need traffic lights and signs, our network needs rules to keep data safe.

**How We Do It**:
- **Separate Areas**: We keep different parts of our system separate for safety.
- **Digital Guards**: We use firewalls to block unwanted traffic.
- **Attack Protection**: We can stop large-scale attacks that try to overwhelm our system.

### Watching for Problems
**The Basics**: We keep an eye on everything that happens in our system.

**Why It's Important**: Just like security cameras help spot problems, our monitoring helps us catch issues early.

**How We Do It**:
- **Activity Logs**: We record important events.
- **24/7 Watching**: We monitor our system all the time.
- **Alerts**: We get notified right away if something looks wrong.

## Following the Rules

### Indonesia's Data Protection Law
**The Basics**: These are Indonesia's rules for protecting people's personal information.

**Why It's Important**: Following these rules keeps us legal and builds trust with our users.

**Our Progress**: Working on It

**What We're Doing**:
- **User Rights**: We let people see and fix their information.
- **Fair Practices**: We're clear about how we use data.
- **Strong Security**: We protect personal information with good security.
- **Quick Response**: We have plans for reporting any data problems.

### Global Security Standards (ISO 27001)
**The Basics**: This is like a gold star for good security practices worldwide.

**Why It's Important**: It shows we take security seriously and follow global best practices.

**Our Progress**: Partially There

**What We're Doing**:
- **Finding Risks**: We look for potential security problems.
- **Controlling Access**: Only the right people can access sensitive information.
- **Using Strong Locks**: We use strong encryption to protect data.

### Cybersecurity Framework (NIST)
**The Basics**: A step-by-step guide for strong cybersecurity from the U.S. government.

**Why It's Important**: It helps us stay ahead of cyber threats in an organized way.

**Our Progress**: Making Good Progress

**What We're Doing**:
- **Understanding Our Systems**: We know what needs protection.
- **Adding Protection**: We're putting strong security in place.
- **Watching for Problems**: We can spot issues quickly.
- **Being Ready**: We know what to do if something goes wrong.

## Always Improving

Keeping our application secure is like painting a bridge - it's never really finished. Here's how we keep getting better:

1. **Regular Check-ups**: We test our security often to find and fix any weak spots.
2. **Staying Current**: We update our security when new threats appear.
3. **Team Training**: We teach our team how to stay secure.
4. **Always Watching**: We keep an eye on our systems 24/7.
5. **Updating Rules**: We keep our security rules up-to-date.
