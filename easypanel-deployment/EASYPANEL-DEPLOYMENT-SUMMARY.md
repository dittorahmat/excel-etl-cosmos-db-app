# EasyPanel Deployment Package - Creation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the creation of the EasyPanel deployment package for the Excel ETL application. Unlike the VPS deployment package which contains pre-built files, this package is designed to work with EasyPanel's Nixpacks build process by including the source code and build scripts.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Source Code Inclusion
- Added backend TypeScript source code in `backend/src/`
- Added shared types in `common/types/`
- Included all necessary TypeScript configuration files

### 2. Build Process Integration
- Verified that backend `package.json` contains a `build` script
- Created `start-easypanel.sh` script that handles the complete build and start process
- Updated root `package.json` with appropriate scripts for EasyPanel

### 3. EasyPanel Configuration
- Created `EASYPANEL-README.md` with specific instructions for EasyPanel
- Simplified the deployment structure to work with Nixpacks

## Files Created

1. **Source Code**:
   - `backend/src/` - Complete backend TypeScript source code
   - `common/types/` - Shared type definitions

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `backend/tsconfig*.json` - TypeScript configuration files
   - `package.json` - Updated with EasyPanel-specific scripts
   - `start-easypanel.sh` - Specialized start script for EasyPanel

3. **Documentation**:
   - `EASYPANEL-README.md` - EasyPanel-specific deployment instructions

4. **Deployment Package**:
   - `excel-etl-easypanel-deployment.zip` - Ready for EasyPanel deployment

## EasyPanel Configuration Instructions

### Nixpacks Settings
1. **Install Command**: `npm install`
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
3. **Start Command**: `npm start`

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in EasyPanel:
- `PORT` - Application port (default: 3001)
- `AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure Cosmos DB endpoint
- `AZURE_COSMOS_KEY` - Your Azure Cosmos DB key
- `AZURE_COSMOS_DATABASE` - Your Azure Cosmos DB database name
- `AZURE_COSMOS_CONTAINER` - Your Azure Cosmos DB container name
- `AZURE_COSMOS_PARTITION_KEY` - Your Azure Cosmos DB partition key
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` - Your Azure Storage account name
- `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` - Your Azure Storage account key
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` - Your Azure Storage container name
- `NODE_ENV` - Node environment (`production` or `development`)

## How It Works

1. EasyPanel extracts the package
2. Nixpacks runs `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Nixpacks runs `npm run build` which compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
4. Nixpacks runs `npm start` which executes the `start-easypanel.sh` script
5. The start script builds the backend and starts the Node.js server

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Compatibility**: Works with EasyPanel's expected build process
2. **Transparency**: Easy to understand and modify
3. **Reliability**: Doesn't depend on pre-built files that might be missing
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to update source code and rebuild

## Deployment Steps

1. Upload `excel-etl-easypanel-deployment.zip` to EasyPanel
2. Configure the Nixpacks settings as described above
3. Set the required environment variables
4. Deploy the application

This deployment package should resolve the issues you were experiencing with the missing `dist` directory and `server.js` file.
