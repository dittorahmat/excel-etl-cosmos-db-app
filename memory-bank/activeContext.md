# Active Context

## Current Focus
Resolving a file upload issue where the process hangs. The investigation has revealed that the file upload process is synchronous, causing the client to wait for the entire file processing to complete. The current focus is on making the file upload process asynchronous to provide a better user experience.

## Recent Changes
- **Asynchronous Upload:**
    - Modified `server/src/services/ingestion/ingestion.service.ts` to split the `importFile` method into `startImport` (synchronous) and `processImport` (asynchronous).
    - The `startImport` method now returns an immediate response to the client, while the `processImport` method handles the file processing in the background.
    - Updated `server/src/routes/v2/upload.route.ts` to call the new `startImport` method.
    - Created a new route `server/src/routes/v2/import.route.ts` to allow the client to poll for the status of the import.
    - Added the new import route to the main router in `server/src/routes/v2/index.ts`.
- **Bug Fixes:**
    - Fixed a syntax error in `server/src/routes/v2/index.ts` where an `import` statement was incorrectly placed inside a function.
    - Fixed a bug in `server/src/routes/v2/upload.route.ts` where a `finally` block was prematurely deleting the temporary file before the asynchronous processing was complete.
    - Corrected the `saveRows` method in `server/src/services/ingestion/ingestion.service.ts` to explicitly pass the container name to the `upsertRecord` method.
    - Fixed a syntax error in `server/src/routes/v2/upload.route.ts` by removing an extra closing brace.

## Problems Faced
- **Synchronous Upload Process:** The initial implementation of the file upload process was synchronous, causing the client to hang while waiting for the server to process the entire file.
- **Syntax Errors:** Introduced several syntax errors while refactoring the code, which caused the server to fail to start.
- **Premature File Deletion:** The temporary file was being deleted before the asynchronous processing was complete, causing an `ENOENT` error.

## Next Steps
1.  Verify that the asynchronous file upload process is working correctly.
2.  Test the new `/api/v2/import/status/:importId` endpoint to ensure it returns the correct import status.
3.  Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and provide feedback to the user on the progress of the import.
