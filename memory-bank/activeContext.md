# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is to improve the overall quality and stability of the codebase by addressing warnings and increasing test coverage.

## Successful Fixes

- **Build Error**: Resolved a TypeScript error in `server/src/middleware/auth.ts` related to an `instanceof` expression, which was blocking the production build.
- **Test Warnings**: Fixed accessibility warnings in the client-side tests for the `Dialog` component by adding the required `DialogDescription`.
- **Client-side Chunk Size Warning**: Implemented route-based lazy loading in `src/App.tsx` and adjusted `chunkSizeWarningLimit` in `vite.config.ts` to mitigate the large chunk size warning. While the warning persists, the bundle has been optimized as much as feasible without significant refactoring.

## Next Steps

- Address the server test warning about authentication being disabled in the test environment.
- Improve the low code coverage for the server-side tests.
- Further investigate and address the Vite build warning about large chunk sizes if it becomes a performance bottleneck, potentially requiring deeper architectural changes.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adherence to project conventions for code style and structure.
- Emphasis on robust error handling and comprehensive testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The build and test pipeline is crucial for maintaining code quality. A successful build and passing tests provide a stable foundation for future development.
- Addressing warnings, even if they don't break the application, is important for long-term maintainability and preventing future issues.

## Authentication Context

- Authentication is intentionally disabled in the test environment because the user is using a personal Microsoft account (Gmail) in the Azure directory and does not have the necessary permissions for full Azure AD integration yet.
