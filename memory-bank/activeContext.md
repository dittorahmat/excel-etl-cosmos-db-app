# Active Context

## Current Focus
With the CI/CD pipeline fixed and the git repository repaired, the current focus is on ensuring the stability of the application and planning for future enhancements.

## Recent Changes
- **Git Repository Repair:** The local git repository was severely corrupted. The `.git` directory was removed and the repository was re-initialized from the remote. This included fetching the latest changes and resetting the local `main` branch.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Fix:** The GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the frontend was fixed by adding a step to create an `.env` file with the necessary authentication secrets before the build process. This resolved a critical login issue.
- **Branch Alignment:** The local `master` branch was renamed to `main` to match the remote repository, and the upstream branch was set correctly.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Strict adherence to linting and type-checking.
- Ensuring all tests pass before considering a task complete.
- Prioritizing clear and correct CI/CD configurations.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Git Corruption:** A corrupted git object can render a local repository unusable, preventing even basic commands like `git status` or `git fetch`. In such cases, re-initializing from a healthy remote is a viable recovery strategy, though it may discard local-only changes.
- **CI/CD Environment Variables:** Frontend applications that rely on build-time environment variables for authentication or configuration must have those variables properly injected during the CI/CD process. Secrets should be handled securely and not exposed in the repository.
