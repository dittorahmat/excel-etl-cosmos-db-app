# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is to improve the overall quality and stability of the codebase by addressing warnings and increasing test coverage.

## Successful Fixes

- **Build Error**: Resolved a TypeScript error in `server/src/middleware/auth.ts` related to an `instanceof` expression, which was blocking the production build.
- **Test Warnings**: Fixed accessibility warnings in the client-side tests for the `Dialog` component by adding the required `DialogDescription`.

## Next Steps

- Address the server test warning about authentication being disabled in the test environment.
- Improve the low code coverage for the server-side tests.
- Investigate and address the Vite build warning about large chunk sizes.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adherence to project conventions for code style and structure.
- Emphasis on robust error handling and comprehensive testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The build and test pipeline is crucial for maintaining code quality. A successful build and passing tests provide a stable foundation for future development.
- Addressing warnings, even if they don't break the application, is important for long-term maintainability and preventing future issues.
