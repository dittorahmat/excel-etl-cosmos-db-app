# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

I have successfully resolved all TypeScript type mismatch build errors after refactoring the Cosmos DB service and updating `CosmosRecord` definitions.

## What has been done

-   Successfully fixed the Azure AD authentication flow, resolving the `AADSTS500011` error.
-   Corrected the server-side JWT issuer validation to accept v2.0 tokens.
-   Enabled the v2 API routes in `server.ts`.
-   Cleaned up linting errors related to unused variables.
-   Ensured all tests are passing.
-   Updated `server/src/services/cosmos-db/cosmos-db.service.ts` to correctly return `ItemResponse<T>` from `upsertRecord`.
-   Updated `server/src/services/ingestion/ingestion.service.ts` to correctly access `_etag` from `result.resource` and added a null check.
-   Updated `mock-cosmos-db.ts` to return `Promise<ItemResponse<T>>` for `upsert` methods.
-   Updated `server/src/types/azure.ts` to reflect the change in `MockCosmosDB` interface.
-   Updated `ApiKey` in `server/src/types/apiKey.ts` to remove the `[key: string]: unknown;` property.
-   Updated `ApiKeyUsageRecord` in `server/src/repositories/apiKeyUsageRepository.ts` and `ImportMetadata`, `RowData` in `server/src/services/ingestion/ingestion.service.ts` to correctly extend `CosmosRecord`.
-   **Resolved `CosmosRecord` Definition Issues:** The `CosmosRecord` interface in `server/src/types/azure.ts` now correctly extends `Partial<Resource>`, making the Cosmos DB system properties (`_rid`, `_ts`, `_self`, `_etag`) optional. This resolved all related type errors in implementing interfaces and classes.

## Problems Facing

-   The Vite build process still shows a warning about a large chunk size, even after implementing lazy loading. This might require further investigation or architectural changes.
-   **Azure AD Application Registration Misconfiguration**: The `AADSTS500011` error indicates that the Azure AD application registration for the API is incorrect or lacks proper consent. This is an external configuration issue that needs to be resolved in the Azure portal.

## Next Steps

1.  Address the `AADSTS500011` error by correctly configuring the Azure AD application registration.
2.  Address the server test warning about authentication being disabled in the test environment.
3.  Improve the low code coverage for the server-side tests.
4.  Further investigate and address the Vite build warning about large chunk sizes if it becomes a performance bottleneck, potentially requiring deeper refactoring or bundle analysis.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   Careful attention to type definitions and return types across interfaces, implementations, and mocks is crucial for a successful TypeScript build.
-   Azure Cosmos DB's `ItemResponse` object contains metadata like `statusCode` and `etag` directly, while the actual resource is nested under the `resource` property. This distinction is important when handling return types.
-   The `_rid`, `_ts`, `_self`, and `_etag` properties are system-generated properties by Cosmos DB and need to be handled correctly in type definitions, especially when extending `Resource` or `CosmosRecord`.
