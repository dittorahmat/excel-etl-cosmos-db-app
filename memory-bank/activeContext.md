# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Successfully implemented dynamic query filtering in the Query Builder.
- Resolved all linting, type checking, testing, and build errors.

## Recent Changes

- **Dynamic Query Filtering**: Implemented server-side logic in `query-rows-exact.handler.ts` to process and apply filters from the client to Cosmos DB queries.
- **Frontend Query Builder Updates**: Updated `QueryBuilder.tsx` and `DashboardPage.tsx` to correctly pass filter data to the backend.
- **Authentication Middleware Fixes**: Corrected `instanceof` errors in `server/src/middleware/auth.ts` by explicitly casting error types.
- **Linting and Test Dependency Fixes**: Addressed `useCallback` dependency warnings in `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` and resolved unused import errors.

## Next Steps

- Continue with further development tasks as requested.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adherence to project conventions for code style and structure.
- Emphasis on robust error handling and comprehensive testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Importance of precise error handling in middleware, especially for security-sensitive components like authentication.
- Careful management of test environments and mocks to accurately reflect real-world behavior.
- Thorough validation of data flow between frontend and backend, especially for complex query parameters like filters.
