# Active Context

## Current Focus
Currently focused on resolving a persistent YAML syntax error in the GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-gray-flower-09b086c00.yml`).

## Recent Changes
- Fixed linting warnings in `server/src/services/cosmos-db/mock-cosmos-db.ts`, `server/src/utils/logger.ts`, and `src/pages/ApiKeyManagementPage.tsx`.
- Corrected failing client-side tests in `src/pages/__tests__/ApiKeyManagementPage.test.tsx` by adjusting the `useToast` mock and updating assertions.
- Ensured all linting, type-checking, and tests pass, and the project builds successfully.
- Attempted to fix a GitHub Actions workflow error related to `working-directory` and duplicate steps.
- Attempted to fix a YAML syntax error in the GitHub Actions workflow file, specifically on line 60, by removing trailing spaces and re-indenting.
- Resolved the `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for the `zod` package in Azure App Service by moving it from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `server/package.json` and updating its version.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Strict adherence to linting and type-checking.
- Ensuring all tests pass before considering a task complete.
- Prioritizing clear and correct CI/CD configurations.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- YAML syntax is highly sensitive to indentation and hidden characters.
- The `Azure/static-web-apps-deploy` action requires specific parameters and their values to be correctly formatted.
