# Architecture Analysis: Potential Issues Identified

## üö® Security Vulnerabilities

1.  **Authentication Bypass in Test Environment**:
    *   **Issue**: Authentication is intentionally disabled in the test environment. While this is for development convenience, it's a critical security risk if this configuration ever makes it to a production environment or if the test environment is accessible externally.
    *   **Recommendation**: Ensure strict separation of configurations between development/test and production. Implement robust access controls for test environments. Consider using feature flags or environment-specific builds to prevent accidental deployment of authentication bypasses.
    *   **Status**: **SKIPPED** (as per user request)

2.  **Overly Permissive CORS**:
    *   **Issue**: If CORS allows wildcard origins (`*`) in production, it can expose the application to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) attacks, allowing malicious websites to make requests to your API.
    *   **Recommendation**: Configure CORS to use an explicit allowlist of trusted origins in production environments.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

3.  **Environment Variable Exposure**:
    *   **Issue**: If sensitive environment variables (like API keys, database connection strings) are logged or exposed in client-side code, it poses a significant security risk.
    *   **Recommendation**: Never log sensitive information in production. Ensure environment variables are properly secured and not exposed in client-side bundles. Use secure methods for injecting environment variables at runtime.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

4.  **SQL Injection Vulnerability**:
    *   **Issue**: If dynamic field names or user inputs are directly inserted into Cosmos DB queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it can lead to injection attacks.
    *   **Recommendation**: Always use parameterized queries or the Cosmos DB SDK's built-in query methods that handle parameterization. Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in queries.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

5.  **Inadequate Error Handling (Information Disclosure)**:
    *   **Issue**: If error responses reveal internal system details (stack traces, database errors), it can provide attackers with valuable information.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement centralized error handling that provides generic, non-descriptive error messages to the client in production. Log detailed errors internally for debugging.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Issues

1.  **Global State/Singletons for Azure Services**:
    *   **Issue**: While convenient, global singletons can lead to tight coupling, make testing difficult (especially unit testing), and can hide dependencies. They can also lead to issues in serverless environments where instances might be reused across requests.
    *   **Recommendation**: Refactor to use dependency injection or pass service instances explicitly. This improves testability, modularity, and makes dependencies explicit.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

2.  **Inconsistent API Design (v1/v2)**:
    *   **Issue**: Mixed v1 and v2 endpoints, inconsistent response formats, no API versioning strategy. This can lead to confusion for API consumers, make maintenance difficult, and hinder future API evolution.
    *   **Recommendation**: Standardize on a clear API versioning strategy (e.g., URL versioning `/v2/`, header versioning). Ensure consistent response formats, error handling, and naming conventions across all API endpoints. Deprecate and remove v1 endpoints if no longer needed.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

3.  **Complex Component State Management**:
    *   **Issue**: Overly complex state management with multiple useEffect hooks in frontend components. This can lead to race conditions, difficult-to-debug state changes, and performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Recommendation**: Simplify state management using custom hooks, state management libraries (if appropriate and not over-engineering), or by breaking down complex components into smaller, more manageable ones. Ensure `useEffect` dependencies are correctly managed.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

## ‚ö° Performance Issues

1.  **Large File Handling (Memory Leaks)**:
    *   **Issue**: Large files loaded entirely into memory during file upload. This can lead to memory exhaustion and server crashes, especially with large files or concurrent uploads.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement streaming for file uploads to process data in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory. Use disk storage for temporary files during upload if necessary.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED**

2.  **Unbounded Token Caching**:
    *   **Issue**: If tokens are cached indefinitely without a proper eviction strategy, it can lead to memory leaks in long-running applications.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement a Time-To-Live (TTL) or a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for the token cache to ensure expired or unused tokens are removed.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED** (TTL already implemented)

3.  **Large Chunk Size Warning (Frontend)**:
    *   **Issue**: The Vite build process still shows a warning about a large chunk size. While lazy loading has been implemented, persistent large chunks can still impact initial page load times and user experience.
    *   **Recommendation**: Conduct a detailed bundle analysis to identify the largest contributors to chunk size. Consider further code splitting, dynamic imports, or optimizing third-party library imports.
    *   **Status**: **ADDRESSED (Mitigated)**

## üß™ Code Quality & Maintainability Issues

1.  **Low Server-Side Test Coverage**:
    *   **Issue**: Low test coverage increases the risk of introducing bugs, makes refactoring difficult, and reduces confidence in the codebase's correctness.
    *   **Recommendation**: Prioritize writing comprehensive unit and integration tests for critical server-side logic, especially for business rules, API endpoints, and database interactions.
    *   **Status**: **PENDING**

2.  **Test Configuration Pollution**:
    *   **Issue**: If test-specific configurations or mocks are inadvertently included in production builds, it can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Recommendation**: Ensure a clear separation between test and production configurations. Use environment variables or build-time flags to conditionally include/exclude test-specific code.
    *   **Status**: **FIXED** (Excluded test files from server build and moved test files out of src directory.)

3.  **Inconsistent Environment Handling**:
    *   **Issue**: Environment variables checked inconsistently (e.g., `import.meta.env.DEV` vs `process.env.NODE_ENV`). This can lead to confusion, errors, and inconsistent behavior across different parts of the application.
    *   **Recommendation**: Standardize on a single, consistent approach for accessing and interpreting environment variables across the entire codebase (frontend and backend).
    *   **Status**: **PENDING**
