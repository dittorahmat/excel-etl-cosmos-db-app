# Product Context

This project aims to solve the problem of efficiently ingesting and managing data from Excel spreadsheets into a NoSQL database (Azure Cosmos DB) and providing tools for data visualization and analysis. It addresses the need for a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to upload data, while also ensuring data security and integrity through Azure AD authentication and API key management.

## How it should work

Users should be able to:

1.  **Authenticate** securely using their Azure AD credentials.
2.  **Upload Excel files** through a responsive web interface.
3.  **Preview** the data from the uploaded Excel files and potentially define or confirm the schema.
4.  **Process and ingest** the Excel data into Azure Cosmos DB.
5.  **Visualize** the ingested data through interactive charts and tables on a dashboard.
6.  **Manage API keys** for programmatic access to the data.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive and User-Friendly**: The interface should be easy to navigate for users with varying technical backgrounds.
*   **Responsive**: The application should provide a consistent experience across different devices (desktop, tablet).
*   **Secure**: User data and access should be protected through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Efficient**: Data upload and processing should be fast and provide clear feedback to the user.
*   **Informative**: Data visualizations should be clear, interactive, and provide meaningful insights.
