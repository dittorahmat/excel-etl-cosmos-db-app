## Current State: Stable & Deployed

The application is currently in a stable, working state. The critical production authentication bug has been resolved, and the simplified, corrected CI/CD pipeline is successfully deploying the application to Azure.

### What Works

-   **Production Authentication:** Users can successfully log in to the live application hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** The GitHub Actions workflow for the frontend is now correctly configured to build and deploy the application with the necessary production secrets.
-   **Local Development & Testing:** The local development environment is fully functional, and all automated tests (linting, type-checking, unit tests, and build) are passing.
-   **Configuration:** The project's configuration has been significantly simplified, removing redundant systems and making it easier to maintain.

### What's Left to Build

-   The core task of fixing the production login is complete. The project is now ready for the next phase of development, which could include:
    -   Implementing new features as per the project roadmap.
    -   Addressing any non-critical bugs or UI/UX improvements.
    -   Expanding test coverage.

### Known Issues

-   There are currently no known critical bugs. The previous production login issue is resolved.
-   The `eslint` command produces several warnings related to the use of `any` types in the `server.ts` file. While not critical, these should be addressed in the future to improve code quality.
