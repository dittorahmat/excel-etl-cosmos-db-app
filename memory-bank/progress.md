## What works

- The application now builds successfully, and all tests pass without any errors.
- Linting and type checking pass without issues.
- Core features, including authentication, file upload, and data visualization, are functional.
- Implemented route-based lazy loading to optimize client-side bundle size.

## What's left to build

- The immediate priority is to address the remaining warnings from the build and test processes to further improve the codebase.
- Investigate and address the Vite build warning about large chunk sizes, potentially requiring deeper refactoring or bundle analysis.
- Improve the low code coverage for the server-side tests.

## Current status

- The project is in a stable state. The build is successful, and all tests are passing.
- The codebase is in a much better state after the recent fixes and optimizations.
- A persistent chunk size warning remains in the build process, but it does not prevent the application from building or running.

## Evolution of project decisions

- The focus has shifted from fixing critical errors to improving the overall quality of the codebase.
- The importance of a clean and warning-free build and test process has been reinforced.
- Decided to implement lazy loading for client-side routes to mitigate large chunk sizes.
