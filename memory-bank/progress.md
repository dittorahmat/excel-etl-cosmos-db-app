# Progress

## What Works
- Linting, type-checking, and all tests (both frontend and backend) are currently passing locally.
- The project builds successfully.

## What's Left to Build
- A functional and correctly configured CI/CD pipeline for deploying the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps and the backend to Azure App Service.

## Current Status
Currently stuck on a persistent YAML syntax error in the GitHub Actions workflow file, preventing successful CI/CD runs.

## Known Issues
- **YAML Syntax Error in Workflow**: The `yamllint` tool reports a syntax error on line 60 of `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-gray-flower-09b086c00.yml`, specifically "could not find expected ':'". This error persists despite multiple attempts to correct indentation and remove hidden characters.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initially attempted to use a single Azure Static Web Apps deployment action for both frontend and backend, which was incorrect for deploying the backend to Azure App Service. The decision was made to separate these into two distinct deployment jobs.
- The current challenge is resolving the YAML syntax issue in the updated workflow file.
