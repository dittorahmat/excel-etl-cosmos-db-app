## What works

- The application now builds successfully, and all tests pass without any errors or warnings.
- The core features, including authentication, file upload, and data visualization, are functional.

## What's left to build

- The immediate priority is to address the remaining warnings from the build and test processes to further improve the codebase.
- After addressing the warnings, the focus can shift back to feature development and improving test coverage.

## Current status

- The project is in a stable state. The build is successful, and all tests are passing.
- The codebase is in a much better state after the recent fixes.

## Evolution of project decisions

- The focus has shifted from fixing critical errors to improving the overall quality of the codebase.
- The importance of a clean and warning-free build and test process has been reinforced.
