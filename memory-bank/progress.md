# Progress

## Current Status
- The application has been refactored for asynchronous file uploads and status polling.
- The Vite build configuration has been corrected to properly bundle vendor dependencies.
- **A critical deployment issue has been addressed.** The `staticwebapp.config.json` has been corrected to resolve the issue of the wrong `index.html` being served in production. The root `index.html` has been restored to its original state to allow for local development.

## Remaining Tasks
1.  **Commit and Push:** The changes to `staticwebapp.config.json` and `index.html` need to be committed and pushed to the repository.
2.  **Redeploy and Verify:** Pushing the changes will trigger a new deployment on Azure Static Web Apps.
3.  **Verify Deployment:** Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure the issue is resolved.
4.  **Frontend Implementation:** Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and provide feedback to the user on the progress of the import.
5.  **Dependency Updates:** Re-attempt updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## Known Issues
- Dependencies are currently outdated.
