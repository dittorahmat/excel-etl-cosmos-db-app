# Progress

## Current Status
-   The application has been refactored for asynchronous file uploads and status polling.
-   The Vite build configuration has been corrected to properly bundle vendor dependencies, resolving the `useLayoutEffect` error.
-   **Client-side build and serving are now successful locally.** The frontend can be viewed by running `npx serve -s dist`.
-   **The backend server now starts successfully locally** using the `start-server-direct.cjs` script, which directly injects environment variables, bypassing previous `dotenv` loading issues.
-   **New Problem:** The frontend is unable to retrieve data from the backend, indicating an issue with API communication.

## What's left to build
-   **Critical Backend Data Retrieval Issue:** The frontend cannot get data from the backend. This needs immediate investigation.
    -   Verify network requests from the frontend to the backend (check browser developer console for failed requests, status codes, and response bodies).
    -   Examine backend server logs for incoming requests and any errors during processing.
    -   Confirm CORS configuration on the backend allows requests from the frontend's origin (`http://localhost:3000`).
    -   Verify API routes and their implementation on the backend.
-   **Core ETL Logic:**
    -   Advanced Excel parsing (handling multiple sheets, complex data types, error rows).
    -   Data validation and transformation engine.
    -   Robust Cosmos DB insertion logic (batching, error handling, upserts).
-   **File Management:**
    -   Integration with Azure Blob Storage for secure and scalable temporary file storage.
    -   Cleanup mechanisms for processed files.
-   **Asynchronous Processing:**
    -   Queue-based triggering of ETL processes (e.g., Azure Queue Storage or Service Bus).
    -   Status tracking for long-running ETL jobs.
-   **User Interface:**
    -   File upload component with progress indication.
    -   Display of ETL job status and logs.
-   **Security:**
    -   Full Azure AD integration for authentication and authorization (currently disabled in test).
    -   Secure handling of sensitive data.
-   **Monitoring & Logging:**
    -   Comprehensive application insights and logging.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Unit and integration tests for all ETL components.
    -   End-to-end testing of the entire pipeline.
-   **Dependency Updates:** Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## Known Issues
-   Authentication is temporarily disabled due to Azure AD permission issues with personal Microsoft accounts in the test environment.
-   Excel parsing is currently rudimentary and needs significant enhancement.
-   No robust error handling or retry mechanisms implemented yet.
-   Scalability aspects (e.g., large file processing, high concurrency) are not yet optimized.
-   Dependencies are currently outdated.
-   **The frontend is currently unable to retrieve data from the backend.**
