# Progress

## Current Status
- The file upload process has been refactored to be asynchronous, resolving the hanging issue.
- A new endpoint has been created to allow the client to poll for the status of the import.
- Several bugs related to the asynchronous implementation have been fixed.
- **Frontend display issues are currently being debugged.** The main problem is a CSS file (`main.W1Mdea1icss`) not loading due to an incorrect MIME type on Azure, despite local builds working.
- **The `main.W1Mdea1icss` filename persists in local builds**, indicating an issue with Vite's asset naming or an unknown source generating this unusual extension.

## Remaining Tasks
1.  **Frontend Implementation:** Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and provide feedback to the user on the progress of the import.
2.  **Dependency Updates:** Re-attempt updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
3.  **Server Verification:** Thoroughly test server startup and functionality to ensure no new errors have been introduced.
4.  **Resolve Frontend CSS Loading:** Identify and fix the root cause of the `main.W1Mdea1icss` filename and ensure CSS loads correctly on Azure.
5.  **Resolve `useLayoutEffect` Error:** Investigate and fix the `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useLayoutEffect')` error.

## Known Issues
- Dependencies are currently outdated as the last update attempt was cancelled by the user.
- **Frontend CSS file (`main.W1Mdea1icss`) is not loading correctly on Azure due to MIME type issues.**
- **The `main.W1Mdea1icss` filename is still being generated in local builds**, despite attempts to force a `.css` extension.
- **`useLayoutEffect` error persists**, potentially related to the CSS loading issue or a separate React/Radix UI bundling problem.
