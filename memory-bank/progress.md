# Progress

## What Works
- Linting, type-checking, and all tests (both frontend and backend) are currently passing locally.
- The project builds successfully.
- The `zod` module not found error in Azure App Service has been resolved by moving `zod` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `server/package.json` and updating its version.
- The YAML syntax error in the GitHub Actions workflow file has been resolved.

## What's Left to Build
- A functional and correctly configured CI/CD pipeline for deploying the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps and the backend to Azure App Service.

## Current Status
- The YAML syntax error in the GitHub Actions workflow file has been resolved. The next step is to verify the CI/CD pipeline.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initially attempted to use a single Azure Static Web Apps deployment action for both frontend and backend, which was incorrect for deploying the backend to Azure App Service. The decision was made to separate these into two distinct deployment jobs.
- The current challenge is resolving the YAML syntax issue in the updated workflow file.
