# Progress

## Current Status
- The file upload process has been refactored to be asynchronous, resolving the hanging issue.
- A new endpoint has been created to allow the client to poll for the status of the import.
- Several bugs related to the asynchronous implementation have been fixed.

## Remaining Tasks
1.  **Frontend Implementation:** Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and provide feedback to the user on the progress of the import.
2.  **Dependency Updates:** Re-attempt updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
3.  **Server Verification:** Thoroughly test server startup and functionality to ensure no new errors have been introduced.

## Known Issues
- Dependencies are currently outdated as the last update attempt was cancelled by the user.
