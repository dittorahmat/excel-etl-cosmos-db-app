# Progress

## Current Status
-   The application has been refactored for asynchronous file uploads and status polling.
-   The Vite build configuration has been corrected to properly bundle vendor dependencies.
-   **Client-side build and runtime errors have been resolved:**
    -   Tailwind CSS compilation errors (e.g., `border-border`, `bg-background`) have been fixed.
    -   `Cannot find module` errors have been resolved by reinstalling dependencies.
    -   React version conflicts leading to `useLayoutEffect` errors have been resolved by removing conflicting CDN script injections.
-   The `staticwebapp.config.json` has been corrected to resolve the issue of the wrong `index.html` being served in production. The root `index.html` has been restored to its original state to allow for local development.

## What's left to build
-   **Core ETL Logic:**
    -   Advanced Excel parsing (handling multiple sheets, complex data types, error rows).
    -   Data validation and transformation engine.
    -   Robust Cosmos DB insertion logic (batching, error handling, upserts).
-   **File Management:**
    -   Integration with Azure Blob Storage for secure and scalable temporary file storage.
    -   Cleanup mechanisms for processed files.
-   **Asynchronous Processing:**
    -   Queue-based triggering of ETL processes (e.g., Azure Queue Storage or Service Bus).
    -   Status tracking for long-running ETL jobs.
-   **User Interface:**
    -   File upload component with progress indication.
    -   Display of ETL job status and logs.
-   **Security:**
    -   Full Azure AD integration for authentication and authorization (currently disabled in test).
    -   Secure handling of sensitive data.
-   **Monitoring & Logging:**
    -   Comprehensive application insights and logging.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Unit and integration tests for all ETL components.
    -   End-to-end testing of the entire pipeline.
-   **Dependency Updates:** Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## Known Issues
-   Authentication is temporarily disabled due to Azure AD permission issues with personal Microsoft accounts in the test environment.
-   Excel parsing is currently rudimentary and needs significant enhancement.
-   No robust error handling or retry mechanisms implemented yet.
-   Scalability aspects (e.g., large file processing, high concurrency) are not yet optimized.
-   Dependencies are currently outdated.
