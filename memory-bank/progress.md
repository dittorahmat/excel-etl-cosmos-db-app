# Progress

## Current Status
- The application has been refactored for asynchronous file uploads and status polling.
- The Vite build configuration has been corrected to properly bundle vendor dependencies.
- **A critical deployment issue has been addressed.** The `staticwebapp.config.json` has been corrected to resolve the issue of the wrong `index.html` being served in production. The root `index.html` has been restored to its original state to allow for local development.
- Despite attempts to control Vite's bundling behavior through `vite.config.ts`, the issue of multiple React-related vendor bundles loading in an incorrect order persists. This required a workaround.
- An automated script (`scripts/add-cdn-scripts.cjs`) has been implemented to inject React and ReactDOM CDN script tags into `dist/index.html` after the build, ensuring they load before other bundled scripts.
- The `package.json` has been updated to run this script automatically.

## Remaining Tasks
1.  **Commit and Push:** The changes to `scripts/add-cdn-scripts.cjs`, `package.json`, and `index.html` need to be committed and pushed to the repository.
2.  **Redeploy and Verify:** Pushing the changes will trigger a new deployment on Azure Static Web Apps.
3.  **Frontend Implementation:** Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and provide feedback to the user on the progress of the import.
4.  **Dependency Updates:** Re-attempt updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## Known Issues
- Dependencies are currently outdated.
