# Progress

## What Works
- The application is now in a stable state.
- The git repository is repaired and fully functional.
- The CI/CD pipeline for the frontend is working correctly, and the application is deployable.
- User authentication is working as expected after the CI/CD fix.

## What's Left to Build
- While the immediate issues are resolved, there is always room for improvement. The next steps could involve:
  - Enhancing the test suite to improve server-side test coverage.
  - Standardizing environment variable handling across the application.
  - Further optimizing the frontend build process to reduce chunk sizes.

## Current Status
- The project is stable and the critical issues have been resolved. The application is in a good state for further development or for use in a production environment.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to re-initialize the git repository was a last resort, but it proved to be the most effective solution for the severe corruption.
- The CI/CD pipeline was refactored to be more explicit about the creation of the `.env` file, which is a more robust approach than relying on environment variables being passed directly to the build command.
