# Progress

This file tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status

*   **Project Setup**: The basic project structure for a monorepo with a React frontend and Node.js backend is in place.
*   **Dependencies**: Core dependencies for both frontend and backend are installed and documented.
*   **Linting**: Linting rules are configured, and initial linting errors have been addressed.
*   **Type Checking**: Type checking is configured, and the codebase passes type checks.
*   **Testing**: Unit tests are configured for both client and server, and all existing tests are passing. Test coverage reports can be generated.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Initial tests for `LoginPage.tsx` have been added, improving client-side coverage from 0% to 1.37% (statements and lines).
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `UploadPage.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/QueryBuilder/QueryBuilder.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/QueryBuilder/FieldSelector.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/QueryBuilder/FilterControls.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/DataChart.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/FileListTable.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/upload/FileUpload.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/auth/LoginButton.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/ui/alert.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/ui/button-variants.ts`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/ui/card.tsx`.
    *   **Client-side Test Coverage**: Added tests for `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`.
*   **Building**: The project can be successfully built for production, generating both client and server artifacts.
*   **Initial Codebase Inspection**: Completed a comprehensive review of the frontend and backend codebase, documenting key components, services, middleware, and utilities.
*   **Key Functionalities Mapped**: Detailed flows for Authentication, Excel Upload and Ingestion, Data Visualization and Querying, and API Key Management have been identified and documented in `systemPatterns.md`.

## What Works

*   Frontend and backend development servers can be started.
*   Code quality checks (linting, type-checking) are integrated.
*   Automated testing is set up and passing.
*   Production builds are successful.
*   Core architectural patterns and component responsibilities are understood.

## What's Left to Build / Known Issues

*   **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Test coverage is still low overall. More tests are needed for other components and modules, especially on the client-side.
*   **Detailed Feature Implementation**: The core features outlined in the product context (Excel upload, data visualization, API key management) need further implementation and refinement beyond their current basic functionality.
*   **Deployment Automation**: While configured for Azure Static Web Apps, full CI/CD pipelines might need further setup or verification.
*   **Memory Bank Population**: The memory bank itself needs to be continuously updated with more detailed information about specific components, functions, and design decisions as development progresses.
*   **Error Handling Refinement**: While a global error handler exists, specific error scenarios might require more granular handling and user feedback.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Potential areas for performance improvement in data querying and large file processing.
