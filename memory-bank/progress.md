# Progress

## Current Status
- The application has been refactored for asynchronous file uploads and status polling.
- The Vite build configuration has been corrected to properly bundle vendor dependencies.
- **A critical deployment issue is being debugged.** The application fails in production on Azure Static Web Apps because it serves the development `index.html` instead of the production build from the `dist` directory.

## Remaining Tasks
1.  **Fix Azure SWA Configuration:** Correct the `staticwebapp.config.json` to ensure the production `index.html` from the `dist` directory is served.
2.  **Clean up `index.html`:** Remove development-only script tags from the root `index.html`.
3.  **Redeploy and Verify:** Deploy the corrected configuration and verify that the application works in production.
4.  **Frontend Implementation:** Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and provide feedback to the user on the progress of the import.
5.  **Dependency Updates:** Re-attempt updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## Known Issues
- **Incorrect `index.html` served in production:** This is the primary blocker.
- Dependencies are currently outdated.
