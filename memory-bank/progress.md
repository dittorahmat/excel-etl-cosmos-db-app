## What works

- The application now builds successfully, and all tests pass without any errors.
- Linting and type checking pass without issues.
- Core features, including authentication, file upload, and data visualization, are functional.
- Implemented route-based lazy loading to optimize client-side bundle size.
- Server-side 401 Unauthorized errors on `/api/keys` endpoints have been resolved by conditionally applying authentication middleware and mocking `req.user` in `server/src/routes/apiKey.route.ts`.
- Client-side `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in `ApiKeyManagementPage.tsx` has been fixed by correcting the API response data access.
- The Dashboard Query Builder is now fully functional, correctly loading fields and displaying query results.
- The API Query Builder now generates correct `curl` commands with full URLs for POST requests.

## What's left to build

- Address the server test warning about authentication being disabled in the test environment.
- Improve the low code coverage for the server-side tests.
- Further investigate and address the Vite build warning about large chunk sizes if it becomes a performance bottleneck, potentially requiring deeper refactoring or bundle analysis.

## Current status

- The project is in a stable state. The build is successful, and all tests are passing.
- The codebase is in a much better state after the recent fixes and optimizations.
- A persistent chunk size warning remains in the build process, but it does not prevent the application from building or running.

## Evolution of project decisions

- The focus has shifted from fixing critical errors to improving the overall quality of the codebase.
- The importance of a clean and warning-free build and test process has been reinforced.
- Decided to implement lazy loading for client-side routes to mitigate large chunk sizes.
- The API Query Builder was refactored to generate `curl` commands for POST requests, aligning with backend expectations.

## Known issues

- The Vite build process still shows a warning about a large chunk size, even after implementing lazy loading. This might require further investigation or architectural changes.
