# Progress

## Current Status
- Server-side issues related to CosmosDB initialization and module resolution have been addressed.
- Build configurations for the server have been aligned.
- The `/api/fields` endpoint has been updated to query Cosmos DB for headers.

## Remaining Tasks
1.  **Dependency Updates:** Re-attempt updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
2.  **Server Verification:** Thoroughly test server startup and functionality to ensure no new errors have been introduced.
3.  **API Endpoint Confirmation:** Verify that the `/api/fields` endpoint correctly returns the unique list of headers as expected.

## Known Issues
- Dependencies are currently outdated as the last update attempt was cancelled by the user.
- The server needs to be restarted and tested to confirm all recent fixes.
